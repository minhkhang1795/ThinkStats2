    "## Group Quarters Status\n",
    "GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and \"Sample Designs\" for more details about changing definitions of group quarters. Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.\n",

WKSWORK2 differs from WKSWORK1 in that responses are given in intervals (1-13 weeks, 14-26 weeks, and so on), instead of the precise number of weeks. This is because the 1960 and 1970 samples recorded weeks worked only in intervals.
